# DMKD_Submission_2023
Source code of AttnCU


### Dependencies / Notes
AttnCU is written in python3 with some code fragments copied from DCGAN implementation from Carpedm20.
  - The code is developed with Python 3.6 and TensorFlow 1.12.0 (with GPU support) on Linux
  - For reasons of my convenience, `data_dir` is required to be `data_dir = ../../data` -- errors might pop-up when other directories are used.
  - To train the model please execute main.py
  
 
 # Dataset
